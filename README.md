# transaction-tracker
A Python project that will track a user's transactions. Users will be able to securely input and view their purchases and perform data analytics to get a better sense of their total spending within an allotted time.

## Currently implemented
So far, we have set up a text-based menu for the user to choose what they would like to do. This includes adding/deleting records, viewing all records, and exiting the program.

## Pending work

Michelle Ho - I have created the text-based menu and will work on an option to perform data analytics on the recorded transactions. This includes The total sum of expense savings for a given period. That also means including a date-time functionality for each record.
